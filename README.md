# Replication-Path-1
Purpose: To meet replication guidelines. Scholars and other public agents can cross validate our computation to find ascertainment bias and other methodical mistakes, computational errors if, any. We have given "checklist linking figures to data, statistics to methodology, data to accessible repositories, originating specimens and the assays that were conducted." Sincerely, Needhi Dharman.
